> Mac menu bar app for Claude Code usage monitoring, efficiency coaching, and cost optimization.

**Status:** Research & Validation Phase

## The Problem

Claude Pro/Max users are frustrated by opaque usage limits. They hit quotas unexpectedly, don't understand what's consuming their tokens, and often upgrade tiers blindly.

**Anthropic won't fix this** — their incentive is for you to upgrade, not optimize.

## The Solution

A lightweight Mac menu bar app that:
- Shows real-time usage and pace
- Alerts before you hit limits
- Breaks down cost by session
- Teaches efficiency patterns
- Recommends when to use Opus vs Sonnet

**Value prop:** Stay on Pro instead of upgrading to Max. Save $180/month.

## Next Steps

1. [ ] Validate demand (Reddit posts, user interviews)
2. [ ] Landing page with email signup
3. [ ] MVP: Basic menu bar + ~/.claude parsing
4. [ ] Beta test with 50 users
