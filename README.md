# 🐑 TokenShepherd

I kept getting rate-limited on Claude Code without warning. So I built this.

TokenShepherd sits in your Mac menu bar and watches your Claude Code quota. It projects where you'll be at reset and tells you *before* you hit the limit — not after.

## The Sheep

A calm sheep means keep working. If it changes color, pay attention.

| | State | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| <img src="assets/sheep-calm.png" width="32"> | **Calm** | Everything's fine — usage is low, no warning trajectory |
| <img src="assets/sheep-orange.png" width="32"> | **Warm** | On pace to run out, or usage above 70% |
| <img src="assets/sheep-red.png" width="32"> | **Low** | Close to the limit, or projected to hit it |
| <img src="assets/sheep-dead.png" width="32"> | **Locked** | Rate-limited — shows when you'll be back |

If the sheep is calm, you never need to click it.

## What You See When You Click

- **Projection hero** — the big number answers "will I run out?" It shows where you're heading at reset, not where you are now. Framed as "AT THIS PACE ~85% at reset 5:00 PM".
- **Activity chart** — your usage pattern over the current window. Hover for details.
- **Collapsible details** — raw numbers for both quota windows (short/long), pace, and reset times. Collapsed by default.
- **Quick actions** — refresh data, copy status to clipboard, open the Anthropic dashboard.

## Notifications

Fires once per reset cycle — won't spam you.

| Notification | When |
|---|---|
| Pace warning | You're burning through quota fast |
| Running low | Usage hits 90% |
| Locked | You've been rate-limited |
| Restored | Limit lifted, you're back |

## Install

Requires **macOS 14+**, **Xcode Command Line Tools**, and **Claude Code logged in**.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jflairie/tokenshepherd
cd tokenshepherd
make install
```

Builds, signs, installs to `/Applications`, and starts automatically on login.

First launch: you may need to allow it in **System Settings > Privacy & Security**.

## Uninstall

```bash
make uninstall
```

Removes from `/Applications` and disables auto-start.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---|---|
| "No credentials" | Log in to Claude Code first (`claude` in terminal) |
| Sheep stays calm/grey | Working as intended — or check that Claude Code is logged in |
| macOS security prompt | Allow in System Settings > Privacy & Security |

## Privacy

Your data stays on your machine. No telemetry, no analytics, no tracking.

TokenShepherd reads the OAuth token from your macOS Keychain and makes one API call to Anthropic every 60 seconds. That's it.
